This program creates the Fishing Game. In this game, the user left clicks on a tile, which represents casting a fishing line. 
A left click will reveal a fish, empty water, or an obstruction. Your score is dependent on the number and type of fish you catch.
The objective of the game is to catch as many high value fish as possible without casting onto an obstruction.
